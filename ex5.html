<h3>Heading Num.2</h3>
A brainstorming  is led by <span style="background-color: rgb(230, 156, 107);">a facilitator</span> who introduces the topic and the above 'rules'. The group then begins to generate and share ideas. These are recorded on white-boards, flip-charts, Post-it® notes, etc. This section of the meeting usually lasts no longer than thirty or forty minutes. The ideas are then categorised and ranked by the group. Follow-up actions are agreed and the meeting closes.

Subsequently, the ideas should be captured more formally and circulated to the group for review. Electronic mind-maps are particularly useful here as they aid visualisation of how the ideas interrelate. Once categorised and mapped, the ideas are more easily evaluated and <span class="span" style="background-color: rgb(243, 235, 125);">prioritised</span> for action.

At the United Nations, we are <span style="background-color: rgb(230, 157, 107);">calling</span> on people everywhere to work together to solve climate challenges and realize the commitments of the 2015 Paris Agreement. This website keeps up with actions taken by governments, businesses, civil society, youth and more in every part of the world.

It’s our planet, and while we know it is in crisis, we also know that solutions are in reach. <span style="background-color: rgb(243, 235, 125);">Progress</span> is already well underway, from more green energy to more secure food supplies.
