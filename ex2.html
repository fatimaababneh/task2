<div class="div1">Storytellers explore the nature of our planet and possible alternate realities in many books, movies, and television shows. The iconic film "Planet of the Apes" (and its sequels) takes place in a future in which astronauts "discover" a planet inhabited by highly intelligent apes and primitive humans, only to realize later, much to their dismay, that – spoiler alert! – it was Earth all along.

    In the long-running and re-booted television series "Battlestar Galactica" – tired survivors of a war with highly evolved robots called Cylons are on a quest to find Earth, a long-lost colony.
    
    In other stories, Earth has been abandoned or destroyed, such as in the Joss Whedon series "Firefly," or the book and its film adaptation "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." In the animated feature "Titan A.E." – Earth has been destroyed by an alien species, but a well-placed planet builder recreates it and all the species that live on it.Kid-Friendly Earth
    Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. Water covers 70% of Earth's surface.
    
    Earth's atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe. The atmosphere also protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up before they can hit the surface.
